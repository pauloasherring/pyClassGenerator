I'm an electrical engineer who has spend most of my career writing software. My background includes Digital Signal Processing, Multimedia programming, Robotics, Text-To-Speech, and Storage products. Most of the code that I've written is in C, C++ and Python. I know Object Oriented Design and I'm a proponent of Design Patterns.
My hobbies include writing software for fun, amateur radio, chess, and performing magic, mostly for charities.

## Basic usage:

make_cpp_class.py <class_name> <input_file_name> [-b base_class_name] [-a author_name] [-f] [-t]

	-b base_class_name, --base_class base_class_name  - Inherit from the named base class.
	-a author_name, --author author_name                  - The author name.
	-f, --full                                                                   - Write full detailed header information.
	-t, --abstract                                                           - Make all virtual methods be abstract methods.
	-h, --help                                                                - Show help and exit
